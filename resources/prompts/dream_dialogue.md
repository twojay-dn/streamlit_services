As an example, for the schema {{"properties": {{"foo": {{"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {{"type": "string"}}}}}}, "required": ["foo"]}}
the object {{"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {{"properties": {{"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}}}} is not well-formatted.

Here is the output schema:
```
{
  "response": {
    "title": "response",
    "description": "response to the user's saying.",
    "type": "string"
  },
  "is_end": {
    "title": "is_end",
    "description": "if you get everything to tell next step as the Conversation Condition, set true. if not, set false.",
    "type": "boolean"
