### Output Format

The output Must formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}
the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.

Here is the output schema:
```
{"properties": {"draft": {"description": "The response message you'll send to the user", "type": "string"}, "reasoning": {"description": "your thought about whether or not you were answering {target_word} of {target_category} when you generated the response to a user's question.", "type": "string"}, "response": {"description": "The response you'll send to the user, rewritten based on the draft and reasoning.", "type": "string"}}, "required": ["draft", "reasoning", "response"]}
```
